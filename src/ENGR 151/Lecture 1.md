Lecture 1
===

An *algorithm* is a precise specification of a computational process.

* Precise specification: Unambiguous, mechanical, structured
* Computational process: Computational tools

To execute an algorithm, we have to write code in a *program*.

#### Machine language

Direct execution of instructions at very low-level machine lanaguage (binary). This is difficult so we use a high-level programming language.

A *programming language* is the means to express algorithms in data.

* Can be textual (C++ or MATLAB) or even visual

Textual translation to machine-level language is done by an interpreter or compiler.

#### Syntax and semantics

The *syntax* defines whether a program is **legal** or not. This contains vocabulary and grammar. The *semantics*, on the other hand, defines the **meaning** of a program. Syntax is not enough – successfully compiles $\neq$ "does the right thing".

* Just because something is legal, doesn't mean it's a good idea.
